    WaterProperties contains methods for calculating properties of water. All methods of WaterProperties are class
    so it is unnecessary to create an instance of the class. See Examples.

    Class Attributes
    ----------------
    SPEED_OF_SOUND_IN_WATER : float
        1442.5 m/s. The speed of sound in water used as a default when necessary.
    TEMPERATURE : float
        8.81187 deg C. Water temperature at which the speed of sound in water is ~1442.5 m/s (as calculated with
        `speed_of_sound()`).

    Methods
    -------
    speed_of_sound(temperature=None)
        Calculates the speed of sound in water

    water_absorption(frequency, temperature=None)
        Calculates the water absorption coefficient

    wavenumber(frequency, temperature=None)
        Calculates the wavenumber of an acoustic wave

    wavelength(frequency, temperature=None)
        Calculates the wavelength of an acoustic wave
